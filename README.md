# Ping IP Addresses

These are just lightweight scripts to ping IP4 addresses.  

## Description

The scripts are to scan network to see which IP addresses are already used and which are still free. There are a few sophisticated scripts from other coders to scan the network. But, sometimes, we just need simple lightweight to work on Windows and Unix based OSes.  

These two scripts are designed for /24 subnet mask for now.
